**CS-305 Software Security**

Client Overview and Software Requirements:

Artemis Financial, a financial services company, requested a software security assessment to identify vulnerabilities in their application. Their primary goal was to ensure the security of their customers’ sensitive financial data by addressing any flaws in their codebase. The company wanted to mitigate risks associated with potential breaches while maintaining seamless application functionality.

Accomplishments in Identifying Vulnerabilities:

When assessing Artemis Financial's software security vulnerabilities, I effectively identified key issues, including improper input validation and lack of encryption for sensitive data. The process of systematically testing for vulnerabilities using tools like OWASP ZAP and static code analysis tools helped identify critical areas of concern. Identifying vulnerabilities is critical because secure coding practices safeguard customer trust and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. Robust software security enhances a company's reputation and protects it from costly legal and financial consequences.

Challenges and Insights:

The vulnerability assessment was challenging, particularly in pinpointing edge cases that could lead to exploits. However, this process also reinforced my understanding of secure development practices. Evaluating the severity and potential impact of vulnerabilities helped prioritize necessary fixes and focus on the most critical aspects of application security.

Enhancing Security Layers:

To strengthen the application’s security, I implemented input validation, used parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection, and encrypted sensitive data using modern cryptographic algorithms. In the future, I plan to use advanced vulnerability scanning tools like Burp Suite and follow security frameworks such as OWASP ASVS to assess vulnerabilities and implement mitigation techniques effectively.

Ensuring Functionality and Security:

After refactoring the code, I rigorously tested the application to ensure its functionality and to confirm no new vulnerabilities were introduced. I employed unit tests, integration tests, and manual testing techniques, focusing on security scenarios to validate that the fixes did not compromise the application’s operations.

Resources and Tools Used:

Key resources included OWASP guidelines, static code analysis tools, and modern encryption lCS-305 Software Security

Client Overview and Software Requirements:

Artemis Financial, a company that provides financial services, asked me to assess their software for security problems. Their main goal was to protect their customers' sensitive financial information by finding and fixing any issues in the code. They wanted to lower the risk of security breaches while making sure the application continued to work smoothly.

Accomplishments in Identifying Vulnerabilities:
While looking for security issues in Artemis Financial's software, I found some key problems, such as weak checks for user input and a lack of encryption for sensitive data. Using various tools helped me find these weaknesses. It’s important to find and fix these problems because secure coding helps protect customer trust and ensures the company follows important rules. Good security also helps avoid legal and financial problems.

Challenges and Insights:

The security check was tough, especially when trying to find hidden issues that could lead to serious problems. However, it helped me understand better ways to write secure code. By focusing on the most important issues, I was able to decide which problems to fix first.

Enhancing Security Layers:

To improve the software’s security, I added checks to make sure input from users was safe, used safer ways to handle database queries, and made sure sensitive information was encrypted. In the future, I plan to use more advanced tools to check for problems and follow industry standards to fix issues effectively.

Ensuring Functionality and Security:

After making changes to the code, I tested the application to make sure it still worked as expected and that no new security problems were introduced. I used different types of tests to check if the fixes worked and didn’t affect how the app functioned.

Resources and Tools Used:

I used resources like guidelines for secure coding, tools that check for code problems, and encryption libraries. Following these guidelines and using thorough testing was very helpful. These tools and practices will continue to help me in future projects to make sure the code is both secure and reliable.

Value to Future Employers:

This project shows that I can find and fix security issues in software. I can show future employers the problems I found, the solutions I applied, and how I improved the code. It also shows my ability to use important tools and techniques for secure software development, which is important for roles focused on security.ibraries. Following secure coding standards and utilizing thorough testing practices proved invaluable. These tools and practices will continue to benefit my future work, ensuring I consistently deliver secure and reliable code.

Value to Future Employers:

This project demonstrates my ability to assess, mitigate, and secure applications against potential threats. I can showcase the identified vulnerabilities, the applied solutions, and the secure refactored code as evidence of my skills. Additionally, the project highlights my proficiency in using industry-standard tools and frameworks, which is essential for roles that emphasize secure software development.
